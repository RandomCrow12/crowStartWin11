# crowStartWin11
Personal fileset for new Win11 boots

Windows 11 has the best day-to-day user experience & compatability by far. However it's customizability and privacy take a little work. 
After trying Arch, I found there was always just one more little problem that would take another hour of forum searching & terminal gibberish to fix.
Additionally, my friends are becoming annoyed with it being a repeated dicussion topic due to my frustrations with a never-perfect OS. (It's really hard not to talk about it at all times.)
Despite my shortcomings, I am still inspired to put my full work & support behind open source projects (from my disgustingly bloated proprietary OS lol).

Suggestions for alternate apps: Ungoogled-Chomium, Spicetify, VSCodium, Tor

I was inspired instead to provide my best setup for Win11 from a fresh installation, in case I or anyone else is in need. Enjoy :3

I can't compress the larger apps & don't want to use git lfs so:
